Documentation | Guide & Areas of Study
-----------------------

The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph:

1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List

3. Incidence Matrix 
4. Incidence List

#### Adjacency Matrix

* [Adjacency Matrix](https://github.com/Koubae/Algorithm-Complete-Guide/blob/master/Graph-Algorithms/graph_adjacency_matrix.py)
- [Adjacency matrix WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix)

Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph. 
 Adjacency matrix for undirected graph is **always symmetric.**

- Graph node represented with adj
- Edge = adj[i][j] = 1 | Edge / Path from i to j.
- Weigthted Graph = adj[i][j] = w (n)

```python
Graph = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],  # Node 1
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],  # Node 2
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # Node 3
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],  # Node 4
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # Node 5
    # 1  2  3  4  5
]
```


- #### Adjacency List

- [Adjacency list WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list)

adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. 

```python
graph = {
    'A': {'B', 'C'},
    'B': {'A', 'D', 'E'},
    'C': {'A', 'F'},
    'D': {'B'},
    'E': {'B', 'F'},
    'F': {'C', 'E'}
}
```

### Spanning Tree & Minimum Spanning Tree

*  Undirected graph

The edges do not point in any direction (ie. the edges are bidirectional), hence if there is a path between V a and V b you can go (a, b) or reverse (b, a).

* Connected graph

Paths are one direction, V a and V b, if only path (a, b) is set then you can't go (b, a).

* **Spanning tree**

A spanning tree is a sub-graph of an *undirected or connected graph*, which includes all the vertices of the graph with a **minimum** possible number of edges. 

If a vertex is missed, then it is not a spanning tree.

The edges may or may not have weights assigned to them.

The total number of spanning trees with n vertices that can be created from a complete graph is equal to n(n-2).

If we have n = 4, the maximum number of possible spanning trees is equal to 44-2 = 16. Thus, 16 spanning trees can be formed from a complete graph with 4 vertices.

* **Minimum Spanning Tree**

A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree in which the sum of the weight of the edges is as minimum as possible.

- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

#### 1. **Understand What a Graph Is**

✅ **Order of study:**

1. Representation → Adjacency list vs matrix    
2. Traversals → DFS, BFS    
3. Shortest path → BFS (unweighted), Dijkstra (weighted)    
4. MST → Kruskal, Prim
5. Topological sort & SCC    
6. Network flow & advanced stuff

A graph is made of:

- **Vertices (nodes)** → the “things”    
- **Edges (links)** → the “relationships”
    

👉 Graphs can be:

- **Directed** vs **Undirected*    
- **Weighted** (edge has a cost) vs **Unweighted**    
- **Sparse** (few edges) vs **Dense** (many edges)    
- Can contain **cycles** or be **acyclic**
    

**Start by learning representations:**

- **Adjacency List** → efficient for sparse graphs    
- **Adjacency Matrix** → easy but heavy on memory

#### 2. **Basic Traversals**

Before anything else, master how to “walk” a graph:

- **DFS (Depth First Search)** → go as deep as possible first    
- **BFS (Breadth First Search)** → visit neighbours level by level
    

👉 These form the foundation for almost everything else.  
Practice detecting:

- Reachability (is node A connected to node B?)    
- Connected components    
- Cycle detection (directed vs undirected)
#### 3. **Shortest Path Algorithms**

After traversals, move to paths:

- **Unweighted graphs** → BFS finds shortest path    
- **Weighted graphs**:    
    - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** → non-negative weights        
    - **Bellman–Ford** → handles negative weights        
    - **Floyd–Warshall** → all-pairs shortest paths        
    - **A*** → heuristic-based (used in GPS, games)

#### 4. **Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)**

For connecting all nodes with minimal cost:
- **Kruskal’s Algorithm**    
- **Prim’s Algorithm**
#### 5. **Advanced Topics**

- **Topological Sort** (ordering tasks with dependencies)    
- **Strongly Connected Components** (Tarjan’s or Kosaraju’s)    
- **Network Flow / Max Flow (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp)** → scheduling, matching problems
- **Graph coloring, bipartite graphs**    
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)** → useful for Kruskal’s, connectivity checks
