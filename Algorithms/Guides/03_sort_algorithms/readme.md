03 Sort-Algorithms 
==================

See the **[Sort-Algorithms](../../src/Sort-Algorithms)** Section in your favorite language
for the sort algorithm. You should follow this order of difficulty:


* InsertionSort
* SelectionSort
* QuickSort
* MergeSort 

The Sort-Algorithms are one the most basic yet important algorithms and should be the first 
algorithm to start too. Many other algorithm are based or depend in many cases in a sort-mechanism 
within their own algorithm, therefore knowning how to sort a Data-structure will automatically 
teach you some required step for other more complex algorithm. 

One example, even if is still a relative simple algorithm is the **Binary Search** algorithm, 
which requires all its values to be sorted in order to work.
