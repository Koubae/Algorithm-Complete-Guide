Bread-First-Search solve issue Shortest Distance from All Buildings

Suppose we want to make a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings
in the shortest amount of distance. We can only move four directions like up, down, left and right.
We have a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where âˆ’

    0 represents an empty land which we can pass by freely.

    1 represents a building which we cannot pass through.

    2 represents an obstacle which we cannot pass through.

NOTE OBJECTIVE:

    Find the Node 0 which has the shortest Path to All the Building (Nodes 1).

INPUT:

    [1, 0, 2, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

OUTPUT: 7

NOTE HINT:

    Calculate distance from Node 0 to 1 individually for each node 1 and then sum it up. The
    smaller value is the result

TODO: Implement with collections.deque
