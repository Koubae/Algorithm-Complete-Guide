### Types of structures

ðŸ‘‰ Key difference from linear structures

- **Linear** â†’ one-to-one relation (next element only).
- **Non-linear** â†’ one-to-many relation (branching, multiple paths).

#### Trees ðŸŒ³

* Binary Tree
	* BST â†’ Binary Search Tree
	* [BST â†’ AVL Tree / self-balancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree)
		* [Red-Black Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree)
* B-Tree (used in Databases)
* B+ Tree (optimized for range queries in DBs)
* Heap
	* Max Heap
	* Min Heap
* Trie (Prefix Tree | Digital tree) â†’ [wikipedia Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
* Segment Tree
* Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)

#### Graphs ðŸ”—

- Directed Graph (Digraph)
- Undirected Graph    
- Weighted Graph    
- Unweighted Graph    
- Cyclic / Acyclic Graph    
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- Adjacency Matrix / [Adjacency List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) (common representations)
