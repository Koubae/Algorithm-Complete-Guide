A deque, also known as a double-ended queue, is an ordered collection of items similar to the queue. It has two ends, a front and a rear, and the items remain positioned in the collection. 

In a sense, this hybrid linear structure provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a single data structure. 

It is important to note that even though the deque can assume many of the characteristics of stacks and queues, it does not require the **LIFO** and **FIFO** orderings that are enforced by those data structures.
