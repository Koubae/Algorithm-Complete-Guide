Data Structures
===================

_Data Structures is a data storage format. It's the collection of values and the format they are stored in, 
the relationships between the values in the collections as well as the operations applied on the data stored in 
the structure._

What is a Data Structure
-------------------------------------------

A data structure is a model where data is organized, managed and stored in a format that enables efficient access and modification of data. There are various types of data structures commonly available. It is up to the programmer to choose which data structure to use depending on the data.

The choice of a particular one can be considered based on the following points:

1) It must be able to process the data efficiently when necessary.
2) It must be able to represent the inherent relationship of the data in the real world.

#### Common Data Structure operations

* Access
* Search
* Insertion
* Deletion

A matrix is known as a **sparse matrix** when it contains more ZERO values than NON-ZERO values.
A matrix that is not sparse is a knows as a **dense matrix.**
